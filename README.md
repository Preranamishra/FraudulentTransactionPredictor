# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud by analyzing transaction data. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, thereby protecting consumers and financial institutions from the risks associated with fraudulent activities.
Key Features

    Data Exploration: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns and identify potential features for model training.
    Model Development: Implementation of several supervised machine learning algorithms, including:
        Random Forest
        AdaBoost
        CatBoost
        XGBoost
        LightGBM
    Imbalance Handling: Use of techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN to address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to recognize minority classes.
    Performance Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) to ensure robust fraud detection.

Dataset

The dataset consists of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent entries. Detailed analysis and preprocessing steps are applied to ensure the data is suitable for model training.
